Excel Templates
===============
The folders in this directory hold blank Microsoft Excel templates for generating valid YODA files according to the following profiles:

**Time Series**: Use this template if you are creating a YODA file for observations derived from in-situ sensors or other regularly spaced time series data (e.g., your input data are formatted similar to a datalogger output file with one date/time column and multiple data columns where each data column represents a different variable).

**Specimens** (under development):  Use this template if you are creating a YODA file for observations derived from physical specimens and your data conform to a cross tabulated format (e.g., one date/time column with multiple data columns where each data column represents a different variable).

**Specimen Time Series**(under development):  Use this template if you are creating a YODA file for observations derived from physical specimens and your data are in a serial format (e.g., one date/time column and one data value column where each row in the table represents an observation of a particular variable).

For example implementations, see the [examples folder](https://github.com/ODM2/YODA-File/tree/master/examples).

The **Old Prototypes** folder contains older versions of the templates.  These should not be used, but we have kept them in case we need to refer back to them.
