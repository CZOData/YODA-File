Excel Templates
===============
The folders in this directory hold blank Microsoft Excel templates for generating valid YODA files. Each Excel template has been developed to serve a single **[YODA profile](https://github.com/ODM2/YODA-File/blob/master/doc/YODA_profiles.md)** for common dataset types, to ease data and metadata input by the end-user.



###Excel templates exist for the following YODA profiles:
1. [Time Series](https://github.com/ODM2/YODA-File/blob/master/doc/YODA_profiles.md)
2. [Specimens](https://github.com/ODM2/YODA-File/blob/master/doc/YODA_profiles.md)
3. [Specimen Time Series](https://github.com/ODM2/YODA-File/blob/master/doc/YODA_profiles.md)

[Other YODA profiles](https://github.com/ODM2/YODA-File/blob/master/doc/YODA_profiles.md#other-envisioned-yoda-profiles) are envisioned.

For example Excel template implementations, see the [examples folder](https://github.com/ODM2/YODA-File/tree/master/examples).

The [prototypes folder](https://github.com/ODM2/YODA-File/tree/master/excel_templates/prototypes) contains older versions of the templates.  These should not be used, but we have kept them in case we need to refer back to them.
